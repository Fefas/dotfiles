# My `vimrc` file

I started to use vim in all my works in the begin of 2013. So I started to be
ansious to find good plugins to make my vim more powerfull. Then I used the vim
configuration of joedicastro for one year until I get boring. It's a very very 
nice `vimrc` file (https://github.com/joedicastro/dotfiles/tree/master/vim) and
I learned so much with it, but I prefer something simpler and more direct.

So I worked in my `vimrc` version 0 and you can see and get it here.

I'm still working in a version with more features and a better documentation.
