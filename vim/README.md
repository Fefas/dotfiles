# My `vimrc` file

I started to use vim to work in the beginning of 2013. Today I use this [vim
configuration](https://github.com/joedicastro/dotfiles/tree/master/vim) (see
this link for learning).

Thanks [joedicastro](https://github.com/joedicastro).

# Tips

* I store my vimrc file into my Dropbox directory and my ~/.vimrc is a link to
  it. In this way I can easier share my vim configurations between my
  diferents devices.
