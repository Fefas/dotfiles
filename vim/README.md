# My `vimrc` file

I started to use vim in all my works in the begin of 2013. So I started to be
ansious to find good plugins to make my vim more powerfull. Then I used the vim
configuration of joedicastro for one year until I get boring. It's a very very 
nice `vimrc` file (https://github.com/joedicastro/dotfiles/tree/master/vim) and
I learned so much with it, but I prefer something simpler and more direct.

So I worked in my `vimrc` version 0 and you can see and get it here.

I'm still working in a version with more features and a better documentation.

# Prerequisites

## Vundle

I use vundle to manage vim plugins. To install, follow the steps:

```bash
$ mkdir ~/.vim/bundle
$ git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

You will

# Tips

1. I store my vimrc file into my Dropbox directory and my ~/.vimrc is a link to
   it. In this way, I can easier share my vim configurations between my
   diferents devices.
